## Overview
This project required building a stand-alone back end which will interact with a static front end. I requested data from a total of six third-party APIs, modified the data as needed, and sent the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. 

## Getting Started
// Creating a server
1. touch server.js
1.5 touch .eslintrc.json
3. GET THE SERVER RUNNING
4. install the packages (libraries) `npm install <PACKAGENAME> <PACKAGENAME> <ETC>`
5. in the js file - load the packages
6. configure the `app`
7. tell the server to listen on the port
8. start writing routes to handle requests from the client

## Architecture
dotenv, express, Heroku, Cors, Node.js and Github
