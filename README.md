**Author**: Riva
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This project required building a stand-alone back end which will interact with a static front end. I requested data from a total of six third-party APIs, modified the data as needed, and sent the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. 

## Getting Started
// Creating a server
// 1. touch server.js
// 1.5 touch .eslintrc.json
// 1.5 touch .env
// 2. run `npm init` (say yes to everything) (creates package.json)
// 3. GET THE SERVER RUNNING
// 4. install the packages (libraries) `npm install <PACKAGENAME> <PACKAGENAME> <ETC>`
//    on day 6- those are express and dotenv
//    dotenv : loads the environment file (".env") for us
//    express: the app itself - runs the server (http requests, responses, cookies, servery things)
//    cors: allows local testing of our server
// 5. in the js file - load the packages
// 6. configure the `app`
// 7. tell the server to listen on the port
// 8. start writing routes to handle requests from the client
